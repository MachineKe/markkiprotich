        <h2>Welcome to Kenya's Renewable Energy Website</h2>
        <p>Kenya's energy mix is dominated by bioenergy, oil products, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and to a lesser extent, coal and hydropower. However, Kenya relies heavily on imported fossil fuels to meet its baseline energy requirements, which makes the country vulnerable to supply and pricing shocks in international markets. The government is taking steps to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p>
